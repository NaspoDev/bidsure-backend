# BidSure Backend

The backend for the BidSure auction web application.

BidSure is a 4th-year university group project for the course ITEC-4020.
My primary responsibility for the project was to design and develop the backend.

### Architecture

The backend follows a microservice architecture with an api gateway, built with Java's Spring framework.
