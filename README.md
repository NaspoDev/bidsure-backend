# BidSure Backend

The backend for the BidSure auction web application.

BidSure is a 4th-year university group project for the course ITEC-4020.
My primary responsibility for the project was to design and develop the backend.

### Architecture

The backend follows a microservice architecture with an api gateway, built with Java's Spring framework.

_Note that there is no auth logic as that was not required for the assignment (and no time to add it in anyways), I might come back later to add it in if I want._
